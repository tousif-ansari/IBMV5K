description: "Use the mkvdisk command to create sequential, striped, or image mode volume objects. When they are mapped to a host object, these objects are seen as disk drives with which the host can run I/O operations. Note that the first syntax diagrams below is for striped or sequential volumes and the second syntax diagram is for image mode volumes. Use the mkvolume command for a simplified way of creating high availability volumes.This includes hyperswap topology. Use the mkimagevolume command for a simplified way of creating an image mode volume, importing existing data from a managed disk."
